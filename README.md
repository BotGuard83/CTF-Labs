# CTF Labs - Red Team & Blue Team Practice

This repository documents hands-on Capture The FlaG (CTF) labs I Build and solve as a **self-taught cybersecurity learner**

The focus is on **real-world attack techniques (Red Team)** and **defensive detection & mitigation (Blue Team)**, not just theoretical exercises.

---

## Objectives
- Build realistic vulnerable services
- Expolit them using common attacker techniques
- Analyze logs, detections, and mitigations
- Document lessons learned like a real enagement

---

## Red Team Skills Practiced
- Web exploitation (auth bypass, rate limiting, file upload, IDOR)
- Enumeration & reconnaissance
- Abuse of misconfigurations
- Credential harvesting & brute force logic
- Unerstanding attacker mindset

---

## Blue Team Skills Practiced
- Log analysis
- Rate limiting & detection logic
- Honeypots & decoy endpoints
- Alerting & response strategies
- Secure coding improvements

---

## Lab Structure
Each lab includes:
- Vulnerable service
- Attack path
- Detection / defense logic
- Flags and explanations

---

## Ethical Notice
All labs are **self-built and isolated** for educational purposes only.
No unauthorized systems are targeted.

---

## Status
This repository is actively updated as my skills progress.
